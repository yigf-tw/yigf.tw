However, on this very day, the domain name of major Internet Service Provider Hurricane Electric (HE, AS6939), HE.NET was suspended. This incident sparked significant discussion on the North American Network Operators&amp;rsquo; Group (NANOG) Mailing List.
The Incident On July 4, 2024, HE.NET was entirely suspended. The reason for this was that their domain registrar, Network Solutions, placed the domain in &amp;ldquo;Client Hold&amp;rdquo; status.</description></item></channel></rss>
